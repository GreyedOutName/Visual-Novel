I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
  File "game/script.rpy", line 285, in script call
    call playerSurvey
  File "game/script.rpy", line 135, in script
    show screen survey with slow_dissolve
  File "renpy/common/000statements.rpy", line 646, in execute_show_screen
    renpy.show_screen(name, *args, **kwargs)
Exception: Screen survey is not known.
